    def collect_feedback(self, category, score):
        self.metrics[category] = score
    
    def generate_health_report(self):
        return {
            'overall_health': sum(self.metrics.values()) / len(self.metrics),
            'areas_of_concern': [k for k, v in self.metrics.items() if v < 7],
            'strengths': [k for k, v in self.metrics.items() if v >= 8]
